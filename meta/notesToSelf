about loading sprites during VBlank:
	vsync is more than 1024 mcycles. this is ~14 tiles.
	right now the code assumes there are less than 14 tiles to load.
	so, one VBlank would be enough for that...
about entry point:
	instead of jumping to start, and then calling all the init
	things,	should use ROP - 'ld sp, Table; ret' where Table is an
	array of pointers to all the init functions, and then to a small
	piece that just says `ld sp, stack_pos; jp start`
